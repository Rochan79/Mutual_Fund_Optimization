# Mutual_Fund_Optimization
 This project covers creating a portfolio out of NASDAQ-100 stocks using 2019 and 2020 data to get maximal returns using integer programming


## Problem Overview
In this project, we pose an analyst at a mutual fund where we come up with a recommendation for how many component stocks to include in the fund and how to pick their weights going forward

## Specifics covered: 
- First we find the best 5 stocks to include in our portfolio and the weights of those 5 stocks, using the 2019 data. Then we check how well does this portfolio tracks the index in 2020?
- We then increase the number of stocks to 10,20,....,100 and analyze the performance of the portfolio. We look for diminishing returns and check what is the optimal number of stocks we should keep within our porfolio.
